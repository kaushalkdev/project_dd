This is an open source project with initiatiative to help PHD students
to record data digitally so that they can easily extract data for
further calculations.

Earlier they used to record data on paper and then manually feed data to
softwares.

With this they can have easy access to formatted data which can be fed to
excel[or any other form] by coverting the data into JSON format.
